Django -> web framework of python

Its a MVT design Module
M- Model (database)
v- View (functions)
T -Template (UI: User Interface)


1st step: Install python
2nd step: Install django by typing in cmd ->py -m pip install Django
	   if this doesn't work and shows no module found, you need to install pip which is a package installer for python.
type in cmd : -> py -m ensurepip --upgrade
This will install pip then you can install django

//maybe install if necessary : pip install django-admin

3: in cmd -> django-admin
this should show available sub command which ensures django has been succesfully installed.

4: create a folder where you are going to create a django project

5: In that folder, open the terminal and type -> django-admin startproject projectname 
this should create a new folder inside the project folder with the respective project name
6: open that folder and you should see another folder with the same name and a file called manage.py
7: open the terminal again on that folder that consists manage.py
8: type: -> python manage.py runserver
9: open the given server link in your browser to check if its working or not.
10: you should not be able to type again in that terminal, to break from it, click 'Ctrl+C'
11: Now you have to migrate your model to run project.
to get it ready for migration, type in cmd: -> py
thon manage.py makemigrations

12: Now migrate it, type: -> python manage.py migrate

13: Now you have to create a super admin 
type in cmd: -> python manage.py createsuperuser
username: any name(admin)
email: not compulsory
password: *anything*  (admin) /* password won't be seen when you type so don't be alarmed.

14: Now run the server again, type: -> python manage.py runserver

15: go to your browser type:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

this should ask for username and password. this is from before when you created the super admin.

pressing the 'Ctrl+C' twice in the terminal will stop the server and has to be started again if required.

// typing -> python manage.py runserver 5000 'will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:5000 
// this is to change the server quote number if numerous servers are required. it can be any number maybe?!


16:  Now open the projectname folder in vs code.

17:  Now we create a app which helps on working on various sectors of the django project separately since giving separate url paths can take a lot of space and be confusing.

18:  open the terminal on the folder which consists of manage.py and type: -> python manage.py startapp products
This should create a new folder along with manage .py
